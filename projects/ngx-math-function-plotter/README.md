# MathFunctionPlotter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.2.
An angular library that has a component for plotting math functions with built in math expressions & single variable computation.

| Operation     | Syntax        | # of operands   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------------:|
| Addition      |     +         |       2         |
| Subtraction   |     sub       |       2         |
| Multiplication|     *         |       2         |
| Division      |     /         |       2         |
| L.Parantheses |     (         |       >=1       |
| R.Parantheses |     )         |       >=1       |
| sin           |     sin       |       1         |
| cos           |     cos       |       1         |
| tan           |     tan       |       1         |
| seq           |     seq       |       1         |
| csc           |     csc       |       1         |
| cot           |     cot       |       1         |
| power         |     ^         |       2         |
| square root   |     sqr       |       1         |
| minus         |     -         |       1         |
